# Epic #140: [Epic] Shell Process Model with Lua Execution

**Status:** In Progress (3/4 complete)
**Branch:** epic-140
**Created:** 2025-12-12
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-12 07:41

## Overview

Create a unified shell experience where the `lua` command provides both script execution and interactive REPL functionality. This eliminates the need for separate REPL tab, Terminal tab, and Run button.

### Goals
- **Unified interface**: Shell becomes the single execution interface
- **Process model**: Each `lua` execution is its own interruptible process
- **Simplified UX**: Remove redundant UI components
- **Interface-based architecture**: Shell defines interfaces, lua-runtime implements them

### Architecture

**Package Structure:**
```
packages/
  shell-core/
    src/
      interfaces/
        ICommand.ts       # Simple commands (ls, cd, pwd)
        IProcess.ts       # Long-running processes
        ShellContext.ts   # Execution context for commands
      ProcessManager.ts   # Manages foreground process
      CommandRegistry.ts  # Registers commands (update existing)

  lua-runtime/            # NEW package
    src/
      LuaCommand.ts           # Implements ICommand
      LuaReplProcess.ts       # Implements IProcess (interactive REPL)
      LuaScriptProcess.ts     # Implements IProcess (script execution)
```
