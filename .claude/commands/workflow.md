# Workflow Reference

Inject the full project workflow documentation.

Read and output the contents of `.claude/workflow.md` - this is the canonical source of truth for how work flows through this project.

After outputting, remind the user:
- `/status` to see current project state
- `/issue next` to start the next available issue
- `/issue <n> begin` to start a specific issue
