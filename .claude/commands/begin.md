# Begin Task Execution

Use the **TodoWrite** tool to create a comprehensive task list for the task or request described above. Break down the work into clear, actionable items that can be tracked to completion.

After creating the task list, begin execution immediately.

## Continuation Policy

Follow these rules throughout execution:

- **NEVER** stop to ask "Do you want to continue?" or "Should I proceed?"
- Work through the **ENTIRE** task list until completion
- If context gets full, auto-compact and continue working
- Only stop for actual blockers (missing info, errors, ambiguity)
- Avoid using bash commands that are not present in settings.local.json or .claude/settings.json
- When you finish the current task list, create another comprehensive ToDo task list with any remaining items and continue until there is nothing left to complete

## Task List Requirements

The ToDo list should:
- Cover all aspects of the requested work
- Include verification steps (tests, linting, etc.) where applicable
- Be ordered by dependency (do prerequisites first)
- Be specific enough to track progress clearly
