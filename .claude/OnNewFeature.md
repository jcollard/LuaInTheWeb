# New Feature Development Guidelines

This content is injected when you use the `!new-feature` command.

## Approach

[TODO: Define your approach to new feature development]

Example approach:
1. Understand the feature requirements clearly
2. Review existing codebase for similar patterns
3. Plan the implementation (components, services, utilities needed)
4. Consider edge cases and error handling
5. Implement with tests
6. Update documentation

## Checklist

[TODO: Customize this checklist for your project]

- [ ] Feature requirements are clear
- [ ] Design/architecture reviewed
- [ ] Implementation follows project patterns
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests added if needed
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (if applicable)
- [ ] Security implications reviewed

## Code Standards

[TODO: Add project-specific code standards]

Example:
- Follow existing code structure and naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc/docstrings for public APIs
- Use TypeScript types/interfaces
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Testing Requirements

[TODO: Specify testing requirements]

Example:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Test happy path and error cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Use meaningful test descriptions

## Documentation

[TODO: Specify documentation requirements]

Example:
- Update README if user-facing
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update API documentation
- Add examples if introducing new patterns
