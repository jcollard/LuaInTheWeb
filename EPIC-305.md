# Epic #305: Canvas Image Support

**Status:** In Progress (0/5 complete)
**Branch:** epic-305
**Created:** 2025-12-17
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17T11:05:00Z

## Overview

Add image drawing support to the canvas Lua API with a preloaded asset manifest system.

### Problem

Users cannot load and draw images in their canvas programs. This limits creative possibilities for games and visual projects.

### Solution

Add a `canvas.assets` sub-library for defining assets before `canvas.start()`, which preloads them into memory. This solves the worker canvas filesystem limitation and provides deterministic loading.

### Proposed API

```lua
-- Define assets before starting (setup phase)
canvas.assets.image("player", "sprites/player.png")
canvas.assets.image("enemy", "/my-files/sprites/enemy.png")

-- Start loads all assets, throws if any fail
canvas.start()

-- Use assets by name (synchronous, already loaded)
canvas.tick(function()
    canvas.draw_image("player", x, y)
    canvas.draw_image("enemy", ex, ey, 64, 64)  -- with scaling
end)

-- Query dimensions
local w = canvas.assets.get_width("player")
local h = canvas.assets.get_height("player")
```
