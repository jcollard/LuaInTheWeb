# Epic #415: Epic: Complete Canvas 2D API Implementation

**Status:** In Progress (11/17 complete)
**Branch:** epic-415
**Created:** 2025-12-22
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-24

## Overview

Implement the complete HTML Canvas 2D API in our Lua canvas library, bringing feature parity with the web standard. This will enable users to create sophisticated 2D graphics, games, and visualizations.

### Goals

- Full HTML Canvas 2D API coverage
- Comprehensive LuaDoc annotations for all functions
- Example programs demonstrating each feature category
- Maintain the simple, Lua-friendly API style

### Architecture Notes

Current flow: `Lua Code → canvasLuaWrapper.ts → DrawCommand → CanvasRenderer.ts → HTML Canvas`

Key considerations:
- **Path state** needs tracking across commands
- **Gradients/Patterns** need object references that persist
- **Pixel manipulation** requires async data return to Lua worker
- All new features should follow existing command serialization pattern
