# Roadmap

This directory contains implementation plans for features and improvements.

## Creating a New Plan

1. Copy `_template.md` to a new file named after your feature (e.g., `user-authentication.md`)
2. Fill out all sections of the template
3. Get plan approval before implementation begins
4. Update status as work progresses

## Plan States

- **Ready for Review**: Plan is complete and awaiting approval
- **Approved**: Plan is approved, implementation can begin
- **In Progress**: Implementation is underway
- **Completed**: Feature is fully implemented and tested
- **Abandoned**: Plan was not pursued (document why)
